&lt;p>The exhibition featured beautiful contemporary takes on the ancient concept of stained glass representations of saints, along with a 40 minute film structured as an imagined dialogue between the journalist and writer G.K. Chesterton and the 14th century mystic Julian of Norwich, two of the individuals featured in the exhibition.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
